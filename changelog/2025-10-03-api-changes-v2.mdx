## Summary


- For the `GET /v2/ingresses` operation, the maximum length for the 'query' request parameter 'hostnameSubstring' has been set to '253'. This change is a warning as it may require client support for this restriction.
- The optional property 'failedExecutionAlertThreshold' has been added to the response with the '200' status for the `GET /v2/cronjobs/{cronjobId}` operation.
- A new optional request property 'failedExecutionAlertThreshold' has been added for both the `PATCH /v2/cronjobs/{cronjobId}` and `POST /v2/projects/{projectId}/cronjobs` operations.
- The optional property '/items/failedExecutionAlertThreshold' has been added to the response with the '200' status for the `GET /v2/projects/{projectId}/cronjobs` operation.
- A new optional 'query' request parameter 'appInstallationId' has been added for the `GET /v2/ingresses` operation.
- The pattern '^[a-zA-Z0-9\\-\\.äöüÄÖÜß]{3,253}$' has been removed from the 'query' request parameter 'hostnameSubstring' for the `GET /v2/ingresses` operation.
