:::caution Breaking changes

This document contains changes that can under certain circumstances be considered breaking. Please review the changes carefully.

While we generally strive to avoid breaking changes in accordance with our [API stability guarantees](../../../../../docs/v2/api/stability), we occasionally might perform changes that would be considered breaking in the strictest sense of the term, but we do not consider as breaking in a practical sense. We will always provide ample notice and documentation for such changes.

:::

## Summary

- The type/format of the `appInstallationId`, `cronjobId`, `customerId`, `fileId` and `projectId` request parameters have changed from 'string'/'uuid' to 'string' for all operations. On a specification level, this might be considered a breaking change; however, this change only reflects the actual behavior of the API, and does not affect the generated client libraries.

- The response property 'chargeability' has become required for the status '200' in the following operations:
  - `GET /v2/customers/{customerId}/extensions/{extensionId}` (extension-get-extension-instance-for-customer)
  - `GET /v2/extension-instances/{extensionInstanceId}` (extension-get-extension-instance)
  - `GET /v2/projects/{projectId}/extensions/{extensionId}` (extension-get-extension-instance-for-project)

- The required property 'chargeability/reasons/isNonChargeableCustomer' has been added to the response with the '200' status in the following operations:
  - `GET /v2/customers/{customerId}/extensions/{extensionId}` (extension-get-extension-instance-for-customer)
  - `GET /v2/extension-instances/{extensionInstanceId}` (extension-get-extension-instance)
  - `GET /v2/projects/{projectId}/extensions/{extensionId}` (extension-get-extension-instance-for-project)
  - `GET /v2/extension-instances` (extension-list-extension-instances)

- The optional property '/items/scheduledDeletionDate' has been added to the response with the '200' status in the following operations:
  - `GET /v2/domains` (domain-list-domains)
  - `GET /v2/domains/{domainId}` (domain-get-domain)
  - `GET /v2/projects/{projectId}/domains` (deprecated-domain-list-domains)

- The following endpoints have been added:
  - `DELETE /v2/domains/{domainId}/scheduled-deletion` (domain-cancel-scheduled-deletion)
  - `POST /v2/domains/{domainId}/scheduled-deletion` (domain-create-scheduled-deletion)
