:::caution Breaking changes

This document contains changes that can under certain circumstances be considered breaking. Please review the changes carefully.

While we generally strive to avoid breaking changes in accordance with our [API stability guarantees](../../../../../docs/v2/api/stability), we occasionally might perform changes that would be considered breaking in the strictest sense of the term, but we do not consider as breaking in a practical sense. We will always provide ample notice and documentation for such changes.
