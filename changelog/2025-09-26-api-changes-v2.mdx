## Client package releases


### Release Summary: mittwald PHP SDK v2.1.147

The latest release of the mittwald PHP SDK, version v2.1.147, introduces several enhancements to improve the robustness and reliability of the `CronjobCommand` class. Key updates include:

- **Required Fields in CronjobCommand**: The `interpreterTemplate` and `pathTemplate` fields are now mandatory, ensuring these critical attributes are always set.
- **Constructor Improvements**: The constructor now requires `interpreterTemplate` and `pathTemplate` as parameters, ensuring they are initialized upon object creation.
- **Type Consistency**: The types for `interpreterTemplate` and `pathTemplate` have been updated to non-nullable strings, enhancing type safety.
- **Removal of Unused Methods**: The methods `withoutInterpreterTemplate` and `withoutPathTemplate` have been removed due to the mandatory nature of these fields.
- **JSON Serialization Simplification**: The `toJson` method has been streamlined by removing unnecessary existence checks for `interpreterTemplate` and `pathTemplate`.
