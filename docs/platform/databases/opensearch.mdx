## What is OpenSearch?

OpenSearch is a distributed, community-driven, Apache 2.0-licensed, 100% open-source search and analytics suite used for a wide range of use cases such as real-time application monitoring, log analytics, and website search. OpenSearch provides a highly scalable system for fast access and response to large volumes of data, with an integrated visualization tool, OpenSearch Dashboards, which makes it easy for users to explore their data. OpenSearch is built on the Apache Lucene search library and supports a variety of search and analytics features.

OpenSearch originated as an open-source fork of ElasticSearch after the latter stopped offering a fully open-source version. Using OpenSearch has the advantage that, among other things, full-text search and many other features are available that can extend the search and analytics capabilities of a CMS. For Magento >=2.4, OpenSearch is a prerequisite for installation.

As a fork of Elasticsearch, OpenSearch is fully compatible with Elasticsearch APIs and plugins.

## Creating an OpenSearch database

You can provision an OpenSearch database in your mittwald hosting environment using [containers](../../workloads/containers). There are two main approaches:

### Using Terraform (Recommended)

The most convenient way to provision an OpenSearch database is using [Terraform](/docs/v2/guides/deployment/terraform) with our [OpenSearch module](https://registry.terraform.io/modules/mittwald/opensearch/mittwald/latest). The following example shows how you can use this module in your own Terraform deployment:

```hcl
resource "random_password" "opensearch_admin" {
  length  = 16
  special = true
}

module "opensearch" {
  source = "mittwald/opensearch/mittwald"

  project_id = "<project-id>"
  initial_admin_password = random_password.opensearch_admin.result
}

output "opensearch_url" {
  value = module.opensearch.url
}
```

After this, you can access your OpenSearch backend using the URL returned by the module. Usually, the URL should be `https://opensearch:9200`. The default username is `admin`, and the password is the one generated by the `random_password` resource.

### Using the mStudio UI

Alternatively, you can set up an OpenSearch container manually:

1. Go to **Containers** in your project in mStudio and create a new one. You can choose any name you like.

2. Enter the image `opensearchproject/opensearch`. You can keep the entrypoint and command as suggested.

3. To make your OpenSearch data persistent, create a volume under **Volumes** as follows:

   - Volume: Create new volume
   - Path in container (Mount Point): `/usr/share/opensearch/data`

4. Set the following environment variables for the container:

   ```dotenv
   OPENSEARCH_JAVA_OPTS=-Xms512m -Xmx512m  # limits OpenSearch RAM usage - extremely important, otherwise 32 GB RAM will be consumed
   bootstrap.memory_lock=true  # together with the previous line ensures no swapping occurs
   cluster.name=opensearch-cluster  # name for the OS cluster
   discovery.seed_hosts=opensearch-test  # specifies which node should be used in the cluster
   node.name=opensearch-test  # name for the OS node
   plugins.security.ssl.http.enabled=false  # enables connection via HTTP, since containers cannot handle HTTPS
   discovery.site=single-node
   OPENSEARCH_INITIAL_ADMIN_PASSWORD=SuperSecurePassword123  # sets the admin password. Since version 2.12 this is mandatory
   ```

The default user for OpenSearch is `admin`.

The suggested port values are standard in the OpenSearch context and can be accepted as is.

### Using the CLI with `mw container run`

You can also deploy an OpenSearch container using the mittwald CLI with the `mw container run` command:

```bash
mw container run \
  --name opensearch \
  --env OPENSEARCH_JAVA_OPTS=-Xms512m\ -Xmx512m \
  --env bootstrap.memory_lock=true \
  --env cluster.name=opensearch-cluster \
  --env discovery.seed_hosts=opensearch \
  --env node.name=opensearch \
  --env plugins.security.ssl.http.enabled=false \
  --env discovery.type=single-node \
  --env OPENSEARCH_INITIAL_ADMIN_PASSWORD=SuperSecurePassword123 \
  --volume opensearch-data:/usr/share/opensearch/data \
  --create-volumes \
  opensearchproject/opensearch
```

This command creates a new container named "opensearch" using the OpenSearch image, sets all the necessary environment variables, and mounts a volume for persistent data storage.

### Using the CLI with `mw stack deploy`

If you prefer using Docker Compose, you can create a `docker-compose.yml` file and deploy it using the `mw stack deploy` command:

1. Create a `docker-compose.yml` file with the following content:

   ```yaml
   version: "3"
   services:
     opensearch:
       image: opensearchproject/opensearch
       environment:
         - OPENSEARCH_JAVA_OPTS=-Xms512m -Xmx512m
         - bootstrap.memory_lock=true
         - cluster.name=opensearch-cluster
         - discovery.seed_hosts=opensearch
         - node.name=opensearch
         - plugins.security.ssl.http.enabled=false
         - discovery.type=single-node
         - OPENSEARCH_INITIAL_ADMIN_PASSWORD=SuperSecurePassword123
       volumes:
         - opensearch-data:/usr/share/opensearch/data
   volumes:
     opensearch-data:
   ```

2. Deploy the stack using the CLI:

   ```bash
   mw stack deploy
   ```

This approach is particularly useful when you need to deploy multiple containers that work together, such as OpenSearch with OpenSearch Dashboards.

### Accessing your container within your hosting environment

Once the container is running, you can verify the instance is accessible by requesting it via `curl`:

```bash
curl -X GET "https://opensearch:9200" -ku admin:SuperSecurePassword123
```

You should receive a response similar to:

```json
{
  "name": "c-fdbzvx-0",
  "cluster_name": "docker-cluster",
  "cluster_uuid": "hABJsptAR9uw7cBXtqaneA",
  "version": {
    "distribution": "opensearch",
    "number": "2.19.1",
    "build_type": "tar",
    "build_hash": "2e4741fb45d1b150aaeeadf66d41445b23ff5982",
    "build_date": "2025-02-27T01:16:47.726162386Z",
    "build_snapshot": false,
    "lucene_version": "9.12.1",
    "minimum_wire_compatibility_version": "7.10.0",
    "minimum_index_compatibility_version": "7.0.0"
  },
  "tagline": "The OpenSearch Project: https://opensearch.org/"
}
```

## Operation

OpenSearch runs as long as the container is running. When using OpenSearch as a search engine for your CMS, the search indices need to be populated by your application. For this, most CMS platforms offer integrations.

The volume is automatically included in the regular backup of your project.

## Setting up common applications

To integrate OpenSearch into applications, an entry is usually required in the configuration file of the CMS. In this section, you will find examples for various CMS platforms.

### Magento 2

For Magento 2, the hostname is simply entered in the app's installation menu. The setup automatically handles the configuration.

### Shopware 6

In Shopware, the `.env` or `.env.local` files already contain lines where connection data must be stored:

```
SHOPWARE_ES_ENABLED=1
SHOPWARE_ES_HOSTS="http://USERNAME:PASSWORD@hostname:9200"
SHOPWARE_ES_INDEXING_ENABLED=1
SHOPWARE_ES_INDEX_PREFIX=sw
SHOPWARE_ES_THROW_EXCEPTION=0
```

USERNAME is always `admin` in our case. The PASSWORD is the `OPENSEARCH_INITIAL_ADMIN_PASSWORD` we set.

Afterwards, the index must be populated via the Shopware console using this command:

```bash
php bin/console es:admin:index
```

To make it visible in the frontend, the consumer must be running and the cache cleared.

### TYPO3

TYPO3 does not natively support OpenSearch, so an extension is required. One possible integration would be [`pluswerk/elasticsearch`](https://github.com/pluswerk/elasticsearch). Alternatively, consider using [Solr](../solr), which is well supported by TYPO3.

### WordPress

WordPress cannot natively connect to OpenSearch, but you can use the [ElasticPress](https://wordpress.org/plugins/elasticpress/) plugin for this. The connection settings must be adjusted in the plugin backend because the CLI extension of ElasticPress cannot handle the initial setup.
Afterwards, indexing can be enabled using the command:

```bash
wp elasticpress index --setup
```
