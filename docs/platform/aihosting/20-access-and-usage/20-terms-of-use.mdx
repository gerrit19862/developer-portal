In addition to the [General Terms and Conditions](https://www.mittwald.de/agb), the following terms apply to the use of mittwald’s AI hosting. These may be updated in line with changes in legal frameworks, technical circumstances, or security requirements.

## Responsibility for use

The user is solely responsible for the lawful use of the service. It must be ensured that all queries, applications, and further use of the generated content comply with applicable law. This includes in particular:

- Data protection requirements (e.g. GDPR),
- Copyright, competition law, and other intellectual property rights,
- Requirements of the EU AI Act, especially in high-risk or regulated applications.

## Prohibited uses

Use of the service is prohibited if it is used to:

- Generate or disseminate content that violates applicable law (e.g. glorification of violence, hate speech, disinformation, malware),
- Engage in practices prohibited under the EU AI Act (e.g. manipulative systems, social scoring, biometric mass surveillance),
- Bypass service security mechanisms or exploit systematic vulnerabilities.

## Use in high-risk applications

Certain application scenarios fall under the “high-risk” category as defined by the EU AI Act (e.g. credit scoring, applicant evaluation, critical infrastructure). These require additional legal obligations, such as:

- Risk assessment and documentation,
- Model and data validation,
- Human oversight measures,
- Conformity assessment.

The service must not be used in such scenarios without fully meeting these requirements in a legally secure way.

## Operation, fair use, and technical notes

- Usage must remain within the stated capacity and rate limits.
- Access must not impair system stability through automated or excessive requests.
- API keys must be kept confidential.
- Model versions may change technically or in content; corresponding tests in integrations must be planned accordingly.

## Disclaimer

The service is provided "as is" without any warranty. No responsibility is taken for the content or effects of the generated outputs. Legal review of the use, exploitation, or distribution is the user's responsibility. Any liability for direct or indirect damages is excluded.

## Model licenses

The provided models may be subject to additional licenses (e.g. Apache 2.0, MIT). Their respective license and usage terms must be observed and are referenced in the model documentation.
