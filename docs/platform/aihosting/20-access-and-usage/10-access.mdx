To use mittwald's AI hosting, you need to obtain an API key. First, you need access to the [mStudio](https://studio.mittwald.de) and an [organization](https://studio.mittwald.de/app/organizations). Both can be created free of charge. Currently, an existing project with an active hosting product is also required.

In your mStudio project, you will see the "AI-Hosting" menu item on the left-hand side. Clicking on it will take you to the API key management interface. Once you finish the booking process, you will receive the API base URL and will be able to create an API key to access the models.
