To be able to use mittwald's AI hosting you need to obtain an API key. First you need access to the [mStudio](https://studio.mittwald.de) and a [organization](https://studio.mittwald.de/app/organizations). Both can be created free of charge. At this time, an existing project with an active hosting product is also required.

Within a project in mStudio, youâ€™ll find the "AI-Hosting" menu item on the left-hand side, which opens the API key management interface. After completing the booking process, you will receive the API base URL and can create an API key to use the models.
