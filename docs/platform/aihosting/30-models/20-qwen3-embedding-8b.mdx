## Description

The Qwen3 Embedding model by Alibaba is designed for creating embeddings, which are essential for a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system. This model does not support chat interaction. It is used to convert documents and texts into individual vectors, which are stored in a vector database by the application, enabling semantic search. The strength of this model lies in its support of over 100 languages with high performance.

The following limitations apply:

- Maximum context length: 32,768 tokens  
- Embedding dimension: 4,096  
- The `dimensions` parameter for dynamically projecting to a lower dimension is not supported

It is recommended to format embeddings for search queries using the following template:

```
Instruct: {task_description}
Query: {query}
```

Here, `{query}` should express the individual search query in *one* sentence, and `{task_description}` should describe the task, for example:
