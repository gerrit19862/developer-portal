mittwald's AI hosting is designed for agencies, freelancers, and their end customers. It is suitable for:

- Agencies looking to integrate LLMs into client projects,
- Developers of SaaS products with AI components,
- Users who want to replace international providers like OpenAI in their AI applications,
- Privacy-conscious or data-sensitive organizations requiring a fully EU-based hosting infrastructure.

Various Large Language Models (LLMs) can be integrated into your applications via an OpenAI-compatible API and used in a wide range of AI scenarios. These use cases include, for example:

- **Text generation** or the implementation of a **chat bot**
- **Image processing**, such as generating image descriptions or alternative texts
- Building a **RAG system** using our container hosting to create a custom, AI-powered knowledge base
- **AI agents** that can autonomously handle complex tasks using tool-calling or as MCP servers

On the following subpages, we explain how to obtain an API key, how to use the offered models with it, and showcase examples of applications.

## Beta phase 

mittwald's AI hosting is currently in a beta phase. During this phase, malfunctions may occur. We reserve the right to replace, add, or remove models during the beta period or to adjust functionalities such as the rate limit.
