title: How to Set Up a Staging Environment
---

import OperationLink from "@site/src/components/OperationLink";

Extensions do not support multiple environments.
You have to create a second Extension if you want to set up separate environments for test and development purposes.

For example, you can register an Extension `My Extension` and the Extension `My Extension - Staging`.
You should configure the second Extension as `hidden`.
For more information, see [Extension reference](../../reference/extensions).
This way, the mStudio won't display the second Extension.
However, you can still add the Extension to a context via the API.
To add an Extension to a context, you can use the operation <OperationLink operation="extension-create-extension-instance" />.

If you add the hidden Extension to a context, the mStudio will display the installed Extension in the corresponding context.
