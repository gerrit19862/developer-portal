title: How to Get Support for Extension Development
---

We use the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/mittwald/contributor-support) for the exchange between contributors and mittwald.
Here you can send questions and feature requests to mittwald and establish contact with other contributors.
Please note that the repository (and all issues in it) is public.

We also use that GitHub repository to announce important changes that concern Extensions.

For private issues, such as a question regarding billing, you can ask our customer service via the mStudio ticket system.

mittwald would not be mittwald if we didn't value the importance of direct communication next to the also important indirect path of communication.
Let us know what you need support with and we will put the technical contact person on the call or in the Teams call.

We are there for you during our regular business hours.
Further information can be found in the “Erreichbarkeit” section at [Mittwald Imprint](https://www.mittwald.de/impressum).
