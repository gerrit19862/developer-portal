title: How to develop a frontend fragment
---

import OperationLink from "@site/src/components/OperationLink";

## Select an anchor

We are working on showing the available anchors directly in mStudio.
In the meantime, available anchors are documented in the [Frontend Fragment Anchors Documentation](../../reference/frontend-fragment-anchors).

## Build the frontend

To develop a frontend fragment, you have to use flow remote components. Currently, it is recommended to build your frontend with **React**,
because [ready-to-use remote components](https://mittwald.github.io/flow/03-components/actions/action-group) for Flow are available.
You are free to choose any framework you like, such as **Vite**, **Next.js**, or others.
However, you have to ensure that library functions introduced further down the page are executed on client side.
Especially with frameworks like **Next.js**, this can be challenging.

For implementing the frontend fragment, you develop a page using these components
and then configure your Extension to use the corresponding URL as fragment for your desired anchor.

To test your frontend fragment, you have to start your frontend application on your local machine and let your (development) Extension point on your localhost,
like described in the [Local Development Documentation](../local-development#testing-frontend-fragments).

### Hello World Example

First, install Flow Remote Components:

```sh
npm install @mittwald/flow-remote-react-components
```

Example frontend fragment:

```javascript
import {
  Alert,
  Content,
  Heading,
} from "@mittwald/flow-remote-react-components";
import RemoteRoot from "@mittwald/flow-remote-react-components/RemoteRoot";
import { useConfig } from "@mittwald/ext-bridge/react";

function SessionInfo() {
  const config = useConfig();
  return <InlineCode>{config.sessionId}</InlineCode>;
}

export default function Demo() {
  return (
    <RemoteRoot>
      <Alert>
        <Heading>Hello World!</Heading>
        <Content>
          This is my first frontend fragment: <SessionInfo />
        </Content>
      </Alert>
    </RemoteRoot>
  );
}
```

### Ingredients used in the Example

#### `<RemoteRoot>`

This component is the root of your Extension.
React components placed under `<RemoteRoot>` are synchronized into the Fragment in mStudio.
It should only appear once in your frontend fragment and the components you may use are limited.
See the caveats about [Limited Components](#limited-components).
When the `<RemoteComponent>` is mounted, you have access to the Ext Bridge.

#### Flow Remote Components

It is important to use the remote version of Flow components.
Instead of `@mittwald/flow-react-components`, you must import from `@mittwald/flow-remote-react-components`.

You can find a full documentation of available components in the [Flow Repository](https://mittwald.github.io/flow).

#### `useConfig()`

Components below the `<RemoteRoot>` do have access to the Ext Bridge configuration by using the `useConfig()` hook.
The config holds some relevant information, like the `userId`, `projectId` or `sessionId`.

### Caveats using Flow Remote Components

There are some limitations, you should know when developing with remote
components.

#### Limited Components

Under the `<RemoteRoot>` component it is only allowed to render the following
components:

- [Flow Components](https://mittwald.github.io/flow)
- `<ul>`
- `<ol>`
- `<li>`
- `<strong>`

You can also build up your own components, but finally they must use the
components listed above.
If you use other components you will see an error in the console, telling what
component is not supported.

#### Limited Custom Styling

The following props will not be applied in the mStudio view.
Therefore it is not possible, to ship your own CSS or styles.
This limitation is not only technical, but also by design and necessary to ensure a consistent look and feel of the mStudio.

- `className`
- `style`

#### Event Data

Most event data will be available to your event handlers, consistent with typical local React development practices.
However, in certain edge cases, event data may be partially missing.
This occurs because events are serialized and transmitted back to your Extension, which can limit access to certain native browser APIs.

If you require support for such cases, please open an issue for further assistance.

### Customize the mStudio page header for your Extension

If you need to customize the mStudio page header — such as the title, breadcrumb, or action elements — you can use the [`@mittwald/mstudio-ext-react-components`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@mittwald/mstudio-ext-react-components) package.

## Connecting Your Own Backend

### When Do You Need a Backend?

Adding your own backend is recommended if you:

- Need to persist data (e.g., user preferences, logs, or other stored information),
- Want to interact with the **mittwald API** (e.g., to retrieve project or customer data),
- Require server-side logic or integrations (e.g., data processing or exposing custom APIs).

Implementing a backend provides full flexibility to implement server-side workflows,
manage sessions, and define complex business logic.

For details on how to implement secure communication between the Extension's frontend and backend,
refer to the section on [Session Handling and Configuration Values via Ext Bridge](#session-handling-and-configuration-values-via-ext-bridge).

## Session Handling and Configuration Values via Ext Bridge

Since frontend fragments run within an `<iframe>`, browser restrictions can complicate cookie handling and session management.

To address this, use the `@mittwald/ext-bridge` package to securely exchange a session token between mStudio, your frontend,
and your backend — ensuring session continuity.
A session token is a JWT (JSON Web Token) that is generated by the mStudio and requested by the Ext Bridge.
It has a very short lifetime and can only be obtained inside a frontend fragment iframe of the mStudio.
Your backend can then validate the session token to authenticate incoming requests of your frontend.

Furthermore, the session token contains a stable sessionId inside its claims.
This sessionId is used to identify the current session.
It gets reset when the user closes the mStudio tab or logs out.
All the informationen such as the `sessionId`, `userId` or `projectId` can be accessed via the Ext Bridge.
For more details refer to [`getConfig()`](#getconfig--useconfig-react).

### Installation

```sh
npm add @mittwald/ext-bridge
```

### How Session Handling Works

1. Your frontend requests a session token before each backend request.
   **Note**: Session tokens are short-lived — always request a fresh token for _every_ request.
   The Ext Bridge will automatically reuse the current token as long as it remains valid.

2. Your backend verifies the session token.

3. _(Optional)_ Your backend may use metadata such as `userId`, `sessionId`, or `extensionInstanceId` for additional authentication or logging purposes.

4. _(Optional)_ Your backend can request an access token to interact with the
   [mittwald API](https://developer.mittwald.de/de/docs/v2/reference/).

### Difference Between Session Token and Access Token

- A **Session Token** is requested **client-side** by your frontend via `@mittwald/ext-bridge`.
  It is short-lived and used to authenticate communication between the frontend and your backend.
  A valid session token proves that a request originates from a logged-in user within mStudio.
  It does **not** (directly) grant access to the mittwald API.

- An **Access Token**, in contrast, is requested **server-side** by your backend — using the session token and your Extension's global secret.
  This global secret is **not** the same as the Extension Instance secret, which is used to authenticate individual Extension Instances.
  An access token is required to authenticate your backend when interacting with the [mittwald API](https://developer.mittwald.de/de/docs/v2/reference/).

> **Important:** Always generate a new access token on demand. Never cache or reuse access tokens.

### Frontend Implementation

#### `getSessionToken()`

Use `getSessionToken()` to generate a session token.

> **Important:**
>
> - Server-Side Rendering (SSR) is **not supported** — this function must be called **client-side**.
> - The method is available **only after** the `<RemoteRoot>` component has been rendered.
> - Do **not** call `getSessionToken()` during initial rendering (e.g., inside `useEffect`).
>   Instead, invoke it **right before** making a backend request.

#### Example: Axios Interceptors

Because session tokens are short-lived, it's recommended to use an HTTP client middleware
or interceptor that automatically attaches a fresh token to each outgoing request.

Example using Axios:

```javascript
import axios from "axios";
import { getSessionToken } from "@mittwald/ext-bridge/browser";

axios.interceptors.request.use(async (request) => {
  const token = await getSessionToken();
  request.headers.set("x-session-token", token);
  return request;
});
```

#### `getConfig()` / `useConfig()` (React)

By using `getConfig()` or `useConfig()` (for react), you can access parameters useful for your frontend implementation.
The return type is:

```typescript
type ExtBridgeConfig = {
  sessionId: string;
  userId: string;
  extensionId: string;
  extensionInstanceId: string;
  appInstallationId?: string;
  projectId?: string;
  customerId?: string;
};
```

Depending on the anchor, the contextual parameters like `projectId` or `appInstallationId` may or may not be present.
For example, if your frontend fragment uses an anchor defined in the main customer navigation menu, neither `projectId` nor `appInstallationId` will be set.

### Backend Implementation

#### `verify()`

Use the `verify()` method to validate a session token.
If successful, it confirms that the request was made by a logged-in user from mStudio;
otherwise, an error is thrown.

#### Session Token Payload

The `verify()` method returns a verified and decoded session token with the
following structure:

```typescript
type SessionTokenPayload = {
  sessionId: string;
  userId: string;
  extensionId: string;
  extensionInstanceId: string;
  contextId: string;
  context: "project" | "organization";
  scopes: string[];
};
```

#### Example: Express Middleware

Example of an Express middleware that verifies the session token and attaches
the payload to the request object:

```javascript
import { verify } from "@mittwald/ext-bridge";

app.use((req, res, next) => {
  const token = req.headers["x-session-token"];
  if (!token) return next("router");

  verify(token)
    .then((session) => {
      req.sessionToken = session;
      next();
    })
    .catch(() => res.sendStatus(401));
});
```

#### Getting an Access Token to Access the mittwald API

You can also use the session token to request an access token for authenticating with the mittwald API.

This operation is secured using your global _Extension secret_.
You can generate or rotate this secret via the API route <OperationLink operation="extension-generate-extension-secret" />.

Once retrieved, make sure the Extension secret is securely stored and accessible only to your backend.
One way to do this is by using environment variables.

You can now use the `getAccessToken` method like this:

```ts
import { getAccessToken } from "@mittwald/ext-bridge/node";

const accessToken = await getAccessToken(
  sessionTokenFromRequest,
  process.env.MY_EXT_SECRET,
);

const projectsResponse = await fetch("https://api.mittwald.de/v2/projects", {
  headers: {
    Authorization: `Bearer ${accessToken}`,
  },
});
```

> **Important:** Always create a fresh access token on demand. Never cache or reuse access tokens.
