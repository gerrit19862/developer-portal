title: How to manage extensions?

import OperationLink from "@site/src/components/OperationLink";

Extensions can be managed primarily through the **mStudio** interface, available in the Entwickeln-Tab for [registered contributors](../become-contributor).  

Alternatively, all actions can still be performed via the mStudio's REST API.  

The API routes related to Extension management are now relatively stable, but may still be subject to minor adjustments over time.

Below is an overview of the key API operations used to manage Extensions.

## Register Extension

To register a new Extension, go to the Entwickeln-Tab in the mStudio and click **"Anlegen"**.  
Only a name is required to get started.

Alternatively, an Extension can be registered using the following REST API operation:

<OperationLink operation="extension-register-extension" />

If you want to test your Extension in a real context during development, you can set an Extension Context during registration.  
This context can still be changed later, as long as the Extension has not been submitted for verification.

## Edit Extension

Once registered, an Extension can be edited at any time in the *Entwickeln-Tab* of the mStudio.  
Here you can update metadata, adjust scopes, upload assets, configure webhooks, and more.

<OperationLink operation="extension-patch-extension" />

When using the API there are a few exceptions to note.

The REST operation <OperationLink operation="extension-request-asset-upload" /> is used to request the upload of assets, such as images for the marketplace gallery.
As a response, you'll receive an Asset Reference ID, which you can use to upload the asset using the <OperationLink operation="file-create-file" /> operation.
Assets can be deleted via the <OperationLink operation="extension-remove-asset" /> operation.

Uploading a logo works similarly. The operation <OperationLink operation="extension-request-logo-upload" /> is used to request the upload of the logo.
The logo is then uploaded using the <OperationLink operation="file-create-file" /> operation.

The Extension Context can also be modified, as long as the Extension has not yet been submitted for verification.
This change can now be made either through the Entwickeln-Tab in mStudio or via the standard edit route.
Depending on whether Extension Instances already exist, the change will either take effect immediately or all Extension Instances will be removed before applying it.

For developing frontend fragments, a global Extension Secret is required. <br/>
Currently, generating an Extension Secret is only possible via the API. 

To generate one, use the <OperationLink operation="extension-generate-extension-secret" /> operation.
The secret will be returned in the response and can then be used in the Extension, e.g., via environment variables.
If the operation is called again, a new secret will be generated.
The old secret will be deprecated and become invalid in approximately 24 hours.
This time window should be used to replace the secret within the Extension.

## Verify Extension

Once your Extension is fully developed and ready for use,
you can request a verification only via our REST API.

This is done using the <OperationLink operation="extension-request-extension-verification" /> operation.

We will review the content of your Extension with in 3-5 business days and either verify it or respond with feedback.

## Publish Extension

Once your Extension has been verified, it can be published
You can publish your extension via <OperationLink operation="extension-set-extension-published-state" />.

This operation also allows for the withdrawal of Extensions. 
This might be useful if you don't want any more new Extension Instances for a certain time. 
This is a separate step to ensure you retain control over when the Extension becomes available to all mStudio users.

To publish the Extension, call the <OperationLink operation="extension-set-extension-published-state" /> operation.
