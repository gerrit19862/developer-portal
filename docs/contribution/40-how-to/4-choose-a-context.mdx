title: How to choose the right Extension Context
---

Choosing the appropriate `Extension Context` is one of the most important decisions when designing and developing an `Extension`.

> **Note:** The `Extension Context` determines whether your extension can be installed at the **project** or **organization** level.

### Why is this decision important?

Your choice has significant impact on:

- 🧩 **Functional capabilities**
- 🔐 **Technical limitations**
- 💸 **Pricing strategy and monetization**

### Decision factors

#### 1. Product-specific considerations

Think about the level at which your product delivers the most value:

- **Organization level**: Makes sense if your product deals with organization-wide processes (e.g., centralized user management, contract handling).
- **Project level**: Suitable for project-specific tools (e.g., deployment features, visualizations tied to a specific project).

#### 2. Technical considerations

Not all technical features are available at the project level:

**Limitations of Project Extensions:**

- Access is limited to resources **at** or **below** the project level.
  This means that access to organizations, contracts, contract partners, etc., is not possible.
- No ability to embed frontend fragments above the project level.
  For example, you cannot add a menu item to organizations.
  Conversely, extensions installed at the organization level _can_ include frontend fragments on the project level and below.
- No cross-project data processing or storage — unless the Contributor explicitly implements this functionality inside the extension.
- No cross-project billing — unless the Contributor makes the extension free in perspective of the marketplace and handles billing entirely on their own.

#### 3. Strategic considerations

This decision will directly affect your pricing strategy:

- Extensions installed on the project level must be **paid for multiple times** — once per project where they’re used.
- On the organization level, **one installation per organization** is sufficient.

> Example: A small tool priced at €1.50 per project can become quite expensive if a customer manages 100 projects.
> This might lead to that customer deciding against using the extension.
