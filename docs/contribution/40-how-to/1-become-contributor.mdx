title: How to become a Contributor
---

import OperationLink from "@site/src/components/OperationLink";

In principle, anyone who is interested can become a [Contributor](../../overview/contributor#what-is-a-contributor).
However, two organizational steps must be completed beforehand so that you can get started:

## Create an organization in the mStudio

To submit Extensions in the mStudio, you need both an mStudio user account and an organization.
Your Extensions will be published in the name of this organization.

If you do not yet have an mStudio user account, you can [register here](https://studio.mittwald.de).

After logging in to the mStudio:

1. Click on **“Organizations”** in the left menu bar or go directly to [this link](https://studio.mittwald.de/app/organizations).
2. Click the **“Create organization”** button in the top right corner.
3. At first, you only need to provide the name of your organization. Additional information can be added later.

## Get listed as a Contributor

You can express your interest in becoming a Contributor with the following API call:

<OperationLink operation="contributor-express-interest-to-contribute" />.

As soon as your organization is listed as a Contributor, you can start developing Extensions.

:::note
Without verification, your Extensions can only be used within your own organization and projects.

## Providing the required information of your Contributor

Once you have [become a Contributor](#get-listed-as-a-contributor),
you can find the information required for verification in the mStudio under the menu item **Contribution/Contributor**.
Here you can provide the necessary information.

Alternatively, you can also set the information using the API command <OperationLink operation="contributor-patch-contributor" />.

## Verification

To request verification, execute the following command:

<OperationLink operation="contributor-request-verification" />.

A Mittwald employee will review your configuration within **two to three business days**.

After verification, you can also request verification for [your Extensions](./2-manage-extensions.mdx#verify-extension).
