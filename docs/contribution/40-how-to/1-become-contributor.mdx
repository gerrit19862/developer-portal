title: How to Become a Contributor
---

import OperationLink from "@site/src/components/OperationLink";

Anyone who is interested can, in principle, become a contributor.  
Before you can get started, there are two organizational steps you need to complete:

## Creating an Organization in mStudio

To contribute and submit Extensions to mStudio, you need both an mStudio user account and an organization.  
Your contributions will be made under the name of this organization.  

If you don’t yet have an mStudio user account, you can [register here](https://studio.mittwald.de).

After logging in to mStudio:  
1. Click on **“Organisationen”** in the menu bar on the left, or go directly to [this link](https://studio.mittwald.de/app/organizations).  
2. Click the **“Organisation anlegen”** button in the top-right corner.  
3. At this stage, you only need to specify the name of your organization. Additional information can be added later.

## Listing as a Contributor

You can express interest in becoming a contributor by calling:  
<OperationLink operation="contributor-express-interest-to-contribute" />.

Once your organization is listed as a contributor, you can begin developing Extensions.

> **Note:** Without verification, your Extensions can only be used within your own organization and projects.
> For a visual representation refer to [Contributor Lifecycle](../30-overview/3-contributor.mdx#contributor-lifecycle)

## Verification

Verification allows your Extensions to be distributed to all mStudio users.  
To complete verification, you must provide the following information:

- [contractOwner](#contract-owner)
- [supportInformation](#support-information)
- [contactPersonUserId](#contact-person)
- [Imprint](#imprint)


### Contract Owner

Your organization must have a valid contract partner.  
If necessary, you can define a different contract partner specifically for the contributor.

### Support Information

Your organization must provide valid contact information.  
You may define separate support information for your contributor.  
This support information will serve as the default for your Extensions.

### Contact Person

You must specify a contact person so we can reach you.  
By default, this will be the user who requested the verification.

### Imprint

Your imprint **must** be compliant with [GDPR §5](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-5-gdpr/).  

- The imprint is **mandatory** and cannot be inherited from your organization.  
- You can either provide a link to your existing imprint or create a new one.  
- To create a new imprint, you may use an online legal notice generator, such as the [Dieter macht den Datenschutz](https://mstudio.mittwald.de/app/marketplace/marketplace/62cfdf0b-9e64-4d48-ae3d-dfa3ba433df4) extension.

After providing this information, call:  
<OperationLink operation="contributor-request-verifcation" />.  

A Mittwald employee will verify your configuration within **two to three business days**.

Once your organization is verified, you can also request verification for [your Extensions](./2-manage-extensions.mdx#verify-extension).
