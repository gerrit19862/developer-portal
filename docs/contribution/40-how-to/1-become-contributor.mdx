title: How to Become a Contributor

import OperationLink from "@site/src/components/OperationLink";

Anyone who wants to can become a contributor in principle.
However, there are two organizational things you need to do before you can get started:

## Creating an Organization in mStudio

To contribute and submit Extensions to mStudio, you need both an mStudio user account and an organization.  
Your Extensions will be published in the name of this organization.  

If you don’t have an mStudio user account yet, you can [register here](https://studio.mittwald.de).

After logging in to mStudio:  
1. Click on **“Organisationen”** in the menu bar on the left, or go directly to [this link](https://studio.mittwald.de/app/organizations).  
2. Click the **“Organisation anlegen”** button in the top-right corner.  
3. At this stage, you only need to specify the name of your organization. Additional information can be added later.

## Listing as a Contributor

You can express interest to contribute by calling:  
<OperationLink operation="contributor-express-interest-to-contribute" />.

Once your organization is listed as a contributor, you can begin developing Extensions.

> **Note:** Without verification, your Extensions can only be used within your own organization and projects.
> For a visualization of the process refer to [Contributor Lifecycle](../30-overview/3-contributor.mdx#contributor-lifecycle)

## Verification

Verification allows your Extensions to be distributed to all mStudio users.  
To complete the verification, you must provide the following information:

- [Contract Owner](#contract-owner)
- [Support Information](#support-information)
- [Contact Person](#contact-person)
- [Provider Identification](#provider-identification)


### Contract Owner

Your organization must have a valid contract partner.  
If necessary, you can define a deviating contract partner specifically for the contributor.

### Support Information

Your organization must provide valid contact information.  
By default, your Support Information will be the email address and phone number of your contract partner. 
You may define deviating support information for your contributor
These support information will serve as the default for your Extensions.

### Contact Person

You must specify a contact person so we can reach you, if problems with your extension occur or we have to inform you about important news concerning the marketplace
By default, this will be the user who created the contributor.
You may define another user of your organisation as contact person.

### Provider Identification

Your provider identlification **must** be compliant with [§5 DDG](https://gesetz-digitale-dienste.de/5-ddg/).  

- The provider identlification is **mandatory** and cannot be inherited from your organization.
- You can either provide a link to your existing provider identification or create a new one.
- To create a new provider identification, you may use an online legal notice generator, such as the [Dieter macht den Datenschutz](https://mstudio.mittwald.de/app/marketplace/marketplace/62cfdf0b-9e64-4d48-ae3d-dfa3ba433df4) extension.

After providing this information, call:  
<OperationLink operation="contributor-request-verifcation" />.  

A Mittwald employee will verify your configuration within **two to three business days**.

Once your organization is verified, you can also request verification for [your Extensions](./2-manage-extensions.mdx#verify-extension).
