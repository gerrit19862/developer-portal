title: How to become a Contributor

import OperationLink from "@site/src/components/OperationLink";

In principle, anyone who is interested can become a [Contributor](../../overview/contributor#what-is-a-contributor).
However, two organizational steps must be completed beforehand so that you can get started:

## Create an organization in mStudio

To submit Extensions in mStudio, you need both an mStudio user account and an organization.
Your Extensions will be published in the name of this organization.

If you do not yet have an mStudio user account, you can [register here](https://studio.mittwald.de).

After logging in to mStudio:

1. Click on **“Organizations”** in the left menu bar or go directly to [this link](https://studio.mittwald.de/app/organizations).
2. Click the **“Create organization”** button in the top right corner.
3. At first, you only need to provide the name of your organization. Additional information can be added later.

## Get listed as a Contributor

You can express your interest in becoming a Contributor with the following API call:

<OperationLink operation="contributor-express-interest-to-contribute" />.

As soon as your organization is listed as a Contributor, you can start developing Extensions.

:::note
Without verification, your Extensions can only be used within your own organization and projects.
:::

## Verification

The information required for verification can be set via the API command <OperationLink operation="contributor-patch-contributor" />.

After you have provided this information, execute the following command:

<OperationLink operation="contributor-request-verification" />.

A Mittwald employee will review your configuration within **two to three business days**.

After verification, you can also request verification for [your Extensions](./2-manage-extensions.mdx#verify-extension).
